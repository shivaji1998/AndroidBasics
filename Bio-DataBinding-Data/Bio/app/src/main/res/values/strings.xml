    <string name="my_bio"> Hello, my name is Paulo Dichone, and I teach programming.
        \n\nMy mission is to help 1 Million students reach their goal of becoming the best developers they can be.
        I want to make you, a well-rounded developer.
        I have extensive experience in Mobile App Development (Android and iOS) and Web Development.
        I am also the founder of <u><i>Build Apps With Paulo</i></u>, where students are equipped with tools they need to become
        well-rounded developers - developers who have soft and technical skills.
        Showing students how to make amazing applications/software is a gratifying experience for me.
        That\'s why I have been teaching online for the past 5 years.
        My goal is to make you a great developer, no matter your experience.
        I enjoy spending time with my growing family, playing the guitar, mandolin, and traveling in my spare time.
        I look forward to helping you become the best developer you can be.
        Thank you so much for being here.
        It means the world to me!</string>
